🏡 India Houses Price Prediction - Linear Regression
📖 Overview
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on historical data. By analyzing key features like location, size, and amenities, we develop a predictive model that helps estimate market value with improved accuracy.
 🔍 Dataset
- The dataset includes various house features such as:
  - Area (sq. ft)
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Location
  - Price history

 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (Data processing)
- Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)


🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
   - Handle missing values  
   - Delete Unwanted Columns  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize price distributions  
   - Identify key features  
3. Model Development 
   - Train Linear Regression Model 
   - Evaluate model performance ( MSE)  
4. Predictions & Insights  
   - Generate price estimates for new listings  

 📈 Results
- Achieved a mean Absolute Error 0f $ 75898.15  in house price predictions.
- The most impactful feature for pricing was Area.

 🏆 Future Improvements
- Experimenting with Deep Learning models for better accuracy.
- Getting  more Data for Accuracy.
